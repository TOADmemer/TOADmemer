### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a variety of HTML projects and Python projects through independent learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, I will soon move onto python 🐍
- 👐 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 💬 Ask me about why I started learning coding!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to do coding on scratch.mit.edu and create animations, These animations were liked by many and resulted in a surge in popularity, Which got me to the top of the "Trending" page very often.
